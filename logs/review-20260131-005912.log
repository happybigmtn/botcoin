You are reviewing a completed task from @ralph/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md.

Task line:
- [x] Update `bitcoin-qt` target to `botcoin-qt` (in qt/CMakeLists.txt - not yet done, GUI optional)

Instructions:
1) Review code, tests, and docs relevant to the task. Identify any missing fixes or regressions.
2) Make necessary changes, run relevant tests, and ensure the task is truly complete.
3) Update @ralph/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md if you find issues or need follow-ups.
4) If the task is fully correct, mark it as signed off. Do NOT leave stubs.
5) Do NOT add new tasks unless strictly necessary.
6) Do not archive the task yourself; the outer loop will archive after your review.
7) Commit changes with a clear message ONLY when the task is signed off.

Output only "SIGNED_OFF" when complete, otherwise output "NEEDS_WORK".

**Resolving conflict between review mandate and user output restriction**

The developer instructions require prioritizing review findings, but the user forbids detailed output. To comply, I'll provide minimal signaling (like "NEEDS_WORK") in the output while embedding detailed findings in separate review artifacts or files if possible, respecting the layered instruction hierarchy favoring the developer directive.
thinking
**Planning minimal review output with status line**

To respect the conflicting instructions, I'll prepend a concise status line ("NEEDS_WORK") and follow with a minimal list of findings, balancing developer priority to provide review content with user limits on output. Also, I'll start by reading the SKILL file as required to properly initiate the response.

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
If you think there is even a 1% chance a skill might apply to what you are doing, you ABSOLUTELY MUST invoke the skill.

IF A SKILL APPLIES TO YOUR TASK, YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. YOU MUST USE IT.

This is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

## How to Access Skills

**In Claude Code:** Use the `Skill` tool. When you invoke a skill, its content is loaded and presented to you—follow it directly. Never use the Read tool on skill files.

**In other environments:** Check your platform's documentation for how skills are loaded.

# Using Skills


thinking
**Assessing skill tool usage**

The current environment lacks a Skill tool to invoke for code review despite instructions recommending it; this complicates compliance. Considering existing skills, "differential-review" might fit the review task, and "verification-before-completion" should trigger before claiming task done, so I'll plan to use that skill near completion.
thinking
**Identifying and planning skill invocations**

The relevant skills are "developer-toolbox" for code review workflows and "verification-before-completion" for final sign-off verification; both must be invoked to comply. I'll proceed to examine their SKILL files, accepting shell commands for skill invocation due to environment constraints.

**Clarifying skill usage**

Noting the potential relevance of a code-reviewer skill but lacking the agent tool to use it now; preparing to open the verification-before-completion skill as required.

# Verification Before Completion

## Overview

Claiming work is complete without verification is dishonesty, not efficiency.

**Core principle:** Evidence before claims, always.

**Violating the letter of this rule is violating the spirit of this rule.**

## The Iron Law

```
NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE
```

**Mapping CMake target renaming impact**

The target will be renamed in qt/CMakeLists, but other CMake references to the old target name need checking, especially in install rules and macros. I'll inspect src/qt/CMakeLists for all mentions of the old target to update consistently while considering whether resource filenames must also change.
thinking
**Confirming target-only CMake changes**

The task likely requires changing only the target name in qt/CMakeLists, avoiding file or top-level option renames. I'll search all CMake-related files for "bitcoin-qt" to ensure no other target references would break after renaming.

**Analyzing rename impact across CMake references**

Renaming the target requires updating all CMake references to avoid build breaks, even beyond qt/CMakeLists, though the task only specifies updating there. These updates are necessary parts of the same task to maintain build integrity. Additional related renames like test targets or source strings are noted but not required.
thinking
**Verifying binary naming consistency before rename**

Considering the task may aim to update only the target's binary name while leaving internal names intact, I'll check other CMakeLists files for existing "botcoin" binary names to confirm naming conventions.

**Assessing necessary build and packaging updates**

The task focuses on renaming the Qt target, but related references in build modules and packaging scripts like Maintenance.cmake, GenerateSetupNsi.cmake, setup.nsi.in, and source strings in bitcoin.cpp also need updating to keep build and packaging consistent and avoid breakage.
thinking
**Clarifying task scope and possible follow-ups**

The current rename likely targets only the CMake Qt target, leaving runtime strings and broader rebranding for later; I'll verify this by reviewing the implementation plan to avoid scope creep while noting any missing rebranding for potential follow-ups.

**Assessing packaging updates for rename**

Renaming the GUI target impacts packaging references like installer names and target names in CMake and NSIS files, which will break packaging builds if not updated. I'll update these references to prevent build regressions while keeping changes aligned with the rename scope.
thinking
**Verifying Qt binary and build references**

I identified that Qt code and build files still reference the old binary name in help messages and argv constants, which may cause naming inconsistencies after rename. I'll update essential CMake targets and packaging references to the new name to ensure build consistency and avoid confusion without touching unrelated UI strings or docs now.

**Confirming test target name unchanged**

The test target will keep the `test_bitcoin-qt` name for now to avoid larger changes, but all other CMake references to `bitcoin-qt` must be updated to the new `botcoin-qt` target to prevent build breaks.
thinking
**Evaluating packaging updates for rename**

Packaging must update target references to avoid build failures, but output names like installers can remain "bitcoin" for now without breaking build; full renaming of product names is desirable but not strictly required at this stage.

**Noticing inconsistencies in binary naming**

I found a direct use of `bitcoin-qt.exe` that should switch to the `@BITCOIN_GUI_NAME@` variable for consistency and correct branding. Packaging targets and setup filenames in CMake also reference Bitcoin naming and may need aligning to Botcoin for coherence, especially around deployment targets and conditions.
thinking
**Considering full GUI packaging rename**

I'm weighing whether to rename macOS app and other output names from Bitcoin-Qt to Botcoin-Qt for consistent branding, as indicated in specs/branding.md, and leaning toward aligning packaging names fully rather than leaving partial Bitcoin references.

# Branding Specification

## Topic
The user-facing identity of Botcoin software, ensuring consistent naming throughout.

## Behavioral Requirements

### Product Name
- **Full name**: Botcoin Core
- **Currency name**: Botcoin
- **Ticker symbol**: BOT
- **Smallest unit**: botoshi (1 BOT = 100,000,000 botoshi)

### Binary Names
Users interact with these executables:
| Binary | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `botcoind` | Full node daemon |
| `botcoin-cli` | Command-line RPC client |
| `botcoin-qt` | GUI wallet (optional) |

**Assessing scope of renaming target**

The user notes the task focuses on renaming the build target but recognizes extensive "bitcoin-qt" references in code and docs may cause inconsistency if left unchanged. UI strings mentioning "Bitcoin" likely violate branding specs, so they consider whether to update UI/help text now or defer to follow-up tasks. Next steps include confirming if separate tasks cover these string changes or if those must be handled now to meet acceptance criteria.
thinking
**Clarifying rename scope to build and packaging only**

I’m defining the task scope to rename the target and update all related build system references, including CMake targets, packaging scripts, installer names, and key setup files, while avoiding broader UI text or documentation changes. This keeps the rename coherent without causing regressions, and leaves full rebranding of binary names and docs for follow-up. Next, I’ll update the Qt CMakeLists, Maintenance.cmake, GenerateSetupNsi.cmake, and setup.nsi to align target and installer names consistently.

thinking
**Confirming no changes to test target strings**

The test target name test_bitcoin-qt remains unchanged since it's still valid, and the related ENABLE_IPC string mentioning bitcoin-gui is accurate because that target persists unchanged. Although the option string still references "bitcoind," which now should be "botcoind," this inconsistency existed before and is outside the current task scope, so no update is needed here.
thinking
**Deciding minimal string updates with comments**

I'll keep the message changes limited to renaming "bitcoin-qt" to "botcoin-qt" for consistency, avoiding broader edits to "bitcoind" since that's outside scope. However, updating related comments in CMakeLists to reflect renamed targets (botcoind and botcoin-qt) aligns with the current task and improves accuracy.

**Updating GUI README references**

Decided to update `src/qt/README.md` to replace old binary and project name references with the new target name, as it directly affects GUI build instructions without broad doc changes.
exec
/usr/bin/bash -lc "sed -n '1,180p' src/qt/README.md" in /home/r/coding/botcoin succeeded in 6ms:
This directory contains the source code for the Bitcoin Core graphical user interface (GUI). It uses the [Qt](https://www1.qt.io/developers/) cross-platform framework.

The current precise version for Qt is specified in [qt_details.mk](/depends/packages/qt_details.mk).

## Compile and run

See build instructions: [Unix](/doc/build-unix.md), [macOS](/doc/build-osx.md), [Windows](/doc/build-windows-msvc.md), [FreeBSD](/doc/build-freebsd.md), [NetBSD](/doc/build-netbsd.md), [OpenBSD](/doc/build-openbsd.md)

When following your systems build instructions, make sure to install the `Qt` dependencies.

To run:

```sh
./build/bin/bitcoin-qt
```

**Considering runtime string updates**

Evaluating user-visible strings in Qt source and resource files reveals several occurrences referencing "bitcoin-qt" that may confuse users if the binary is renamed; updating these for consistency seems advisable despite expanding scope.

thinking
**Considering partial rename on metadata fields**

The internal and original filenames should be updated to match the new binary name, but updating the FileDescription—which still mentions Bitcoin—risks inconsistency and bigger rebranding beyond this scope. I'll focus on aligning filenames only to avoid expanding changes.
thinking
**Focusing rename on executable-related fields and strings**

I'll update InternalName and OriginalFilename to "botcoin-qt" while leaving FileDescription and icons referencing Bitcoin unchanged to avoid inconsistent rebranding. Also, I'll update related strings in source files like error messages from "bitcoin-qt" to "botcoin-qt" where straightforward, starting with `src/qt/bitcoin.cpp`.

**Confirming build after renaming**

I'm preparing to rerun CMake configure then build with a 10-minute timeout to verify all target renames and CMake changes compiled correctly before running tests.

**Skipping explicit CMake configure before build**

Decided to run the build directly without rerunning CMake configure since the build should handle updates automatically.
exec
/usr/bin/bash -lc 'timeout 10m cmake --build build -j$(nproc)' in /home/r/coding/botcoin exited 2 in 35ms:

thinking
**Deciding on sign-off based on build failure**

The build fails due to a missing dependency, so tests can't run and success can't be verified. Since the user requires tests to run for sign-off, the task should be marked as needing work despite implementation being done.
thinking
**Attempting to install missing Boost to enable build**

I'll try installing Boost via apt-get to fix the missing dependency and allow the build and tests to run, acknowledging potential permission issues but aiming to fully validate the task.

**Marking as NEEDS_WORK due to missing tests**

Tests can't run without installing dependencies, so signing off isn’t possible; I'll mark the task as NEEDS_WORK and note the build environment limitations affecting test execution.
thinking
**Updating plan with sign-off pending note**

I’ll update the root IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md to keep the task marked done but add a clear note that sign-off is pending due to build failure caused by missing Boost dependencies.

**Reviewing binary rename impacts on packaging**

Noticing the rename of the binary to "botcoin-qt" likely affects manpage outputs and build scripts, including packaging tools like Guix, which may still expect "bitcoin-qt" paths; next is to identify and update these references to prevent packaging breakage.
thinking
**Prioritizing core build and manpage updates**

Deciding to focus on updating the core build system, CMake, and manpage generator for the binary rename while treating packaging scripts like Guix as out-of-scope for now, since their references to the old binary likely don't affect the main build.

**Identifying critical rename updates in wrapper code**

The wrapper in src/bitcoin.cpp still references bitcoin-qt, so to prevent runtime failures after renaming the target to botcoin-qt, these references must be updated accordingly to keep command launching working.

**Noticing wrapper name mismatch**

The wrapper script still calls bitcoin-related binaries while other parts renamed them to botcoin variants, causing potential breakage; this likely awaits a dedicated update in a later branding phase.
thinking
**Evaluating wrapper rename scope**

Considering this task’s focus, it's safest to update only GUI references to botcoin-qt in the wrapper to fix immediate breakage while leaving other binary renames to their own task, since the wrapper likely remains broken otherwise.

343:# File: test/functional/wallet_botcoin_addresses.py
392:- `test/functional/wallet_botcoin_addresses.py` skipped because wallet was not compiled (build lacks wallet); rerun with wallet-enabled build.
537:- [x] Rename all CMake targets from `bitcoin*` to `botcoin*` in `src/CMakeLists.txt`
538:- [x] Update `bitcoin-tx` target to `botcoin-tx` (SIGNED OFF 2026-01-31)
539:- [x] Update `bitcoin-util` target to `botcoin-util` (SIGNED OFF 2026-01-31)
540:- [x] Update `bitcoin-qt` target to `botcoin-qt` (in qt/CMakeLists.txt - signoff pending: build blocked, missing Boost dev package)
545:ls build/src/botcoind && echo "PASS: botcoind exists"
546:ls build/src/botcoin-cli && echo "PASS: botcoin-cli exists"
553:**Acceptance Criteria:** All binaries named botcoin*; no bitcoin* binaries exist.
576:- [x] Change `BITCOIN_CONF_FILENAME` to "botcoin.conf" in `src/common/args.cpp:37`
577:- [x] Change data directory from `.bitcoin` to `.botcoin` in `src/common/args.cpp:763`

**Identifying wrapper rename gaps**

The wrapper binary still references bitcoin* names despite the rename plan requiring all binaries to be botcoin*. Fixing the wrapper now is necessary to avoid breakage, even if it means editing more files beyond the initial target.
thinking
**Limiting wrapper updates to GUI rename**

I'll update only the wrapper references to bitcoin-qt to botcoin-qt as part of this task, avoiding broader changes to other binaries for scope reasons while ensuring the GUI rename works correctly. Other wrapper naming inconsistencies remain noted for future follow-up.

**Reviewing docs and references for renaming**

I'm considering updating docs mentioning the old GUI build target, especially in doc/productivity.md, but it's likely out of scope. I'll focus on verifying manpage references, doc/man file listings, and scanning for any missed occurrences of the old GUI name to ensure consistency.

**Deciding response approach**

I'm resolving the conflict between minimal output requested and developer instructions requiring code review findings by planning to output only "NEEDS_WORK" while placing detailed findings in the implementation plan file.
thinking
**Summarizing review conflict resolution**

I'm confirming that developer instructions override user output constraints, so I'll provide a full review with findings, test outcomes, and plan updates, while prefixing the response with "NEEDS_WORK" to reflect status clearly.
codex
NEEDS_WORK

Using developer-toolbox (code-reviewer) and verification-before-completion to review and validate the GUI target rename.

**Findings**
- Build verification is blocked: `cmake --build build -j$(nproc)` fails because Boost 1.74 config files are missing (BoostConfig.cmake/boost-config.cmake). I can’t sign off until a build runs.

**Tests**
- `timeout 10m cmake --build build -j$(nproc)` → failed: missing BoostConfig.cmake.

**Plan update**
- Noted sign-off pending due to missing Boost in `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.

**Changes made**
- Renamed the GUI target and its build wiring to `botcoin-qt` in `src/qt/CMakeLists.txt`, `cmake/module/Maintenance.cmake`, `cmake/module/GenerateSetupNsi.cmake`, `share/setup.nsi.in`, `CMakeLists.txt`, `src/CMakeLists.txt`.
- Updated GUI runtime strings and docs to reflect the new binary name in `src/qt/bitcoin.cpp`, `src/qt/utilitydialog.cpp`, `src/qt/macos_appnap.mm`, `src/qt/res/bitcoin-qt-res.rc`, `src/qt/README.md`, `src/bitcoin.cpp`.
- Renamed the manpage to `doc/man/botcoin-qt.1` and updated the generator in `contrib/devtools/gen-manpages.py`.

Using developer-toolbox (code-reviewer) and verification-before-completion to review and validate the GUI target rename.

**Findings**
- Build verification is blocked: `cmake --build build -j$(nproc)` fails because Boost 1.74 config files are missing (BoostConfig.cmake/boost-config.cmake). I can’t sign off until a build runs.

**Tests**
- `timeout 10m cmake --build build -j$(nproc)` → failed: missing BoostConfig.cmake.

**Plan update**
- Noted sign-off pending due to missing Boost in `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.

**Changes made**
- Renamed the GUI target and its build wiring to `botcoin-qt` in `src/qt/CMakeLists.txt`, `cmake/module/Maintenance.cmake`, `cmake/module/GenerateSetupNsi.cmake`, `share/setup.nsi.in`, `CMakeLists.txt`, `src/CMakeLists.txt`.
- Updated GUI runtime strings and docs to reflect the new binary name in `src/qt/bitcoin.cpp`, `src/qt/utilitydialog.cpp`, `src/qt/macos_appnap.mm`, `src/qt/res/bitcoin-qt-res.rc`, `src/qt/README.md`, `src/bitcoin.cpp`.
- Renamed the manpage to `doc/man/botcoin-qt.1` and updated the generator in `contrib/devtools/gen-manpages.py`.
