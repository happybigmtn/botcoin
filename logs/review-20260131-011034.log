You are reviewing a completed task from @ralph/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md.

Task line:
- [x] Change `UA_NAME` from "Satoshi" to "Botcoin" in `src/clientversion.cpp:24`

Instructions:
1) Review code, tests, and docs relevant to the task. Identify any missing fixes or regressions.
2) Make necessary changes, run relevant tests, and ensure the task is truly complete.
3) Update @ralph/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md if you find issues or need follow-ups.
4) If the task is fully correct, mark it as signed off. Do NOT leave stubs.
5) Do NOT add new tasks unless strictly necessary.
6) Do not archive the task yourself; the outer loop will archive after your review.
7) Commit changes with a clear message ONLY when the task is signed off.

**Deciding to read required skill file**

I'm prioritizing reading the "using-superpowers" skill file first to comply with mandatory system rules before further task actions.

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
If you think there is even a 1% chance a skill might apply to what you are doing, you ABSOLUTELY MUST invoke the skill.

IF A SKILL APPLIES TO YOUR TASK, YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. YOU MUST USE IT.

This is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.

## How to Access Skills

**In Claude Code:** Use the `Skill` tool. When you invoke a skill, its content is loaded and presented to you—follow it directly. Never use the Read tool on skill files.

**In other environments:** Check your platform's documentation for how skills are loaded.
